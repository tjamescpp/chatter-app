## Chatter - Social Media Web App

-   I created a mock social media web app using Python Django as a personal
    project.
-   It's a chat room app that has rooms for different subjects (e.g. Sports)
-   The app is deployed on Render. It may take a few minutes to load because
    it's using the free version.

The home page will ask you to login. I've created a default user to showcase the
app.
