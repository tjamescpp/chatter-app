Full-stack Social Media Web App
* I created a mock social media web app using Python Django as a personal project.
* It's a chatroom app that has posts for different subjects, a home feed that shows all of your posts, and other users posts in the chatrooms. 
* The app is deployed on Render. It may take a few minutes to load because it's using the free version.
  
The home page will ask you to login. I've created a default user to showcase the app.
